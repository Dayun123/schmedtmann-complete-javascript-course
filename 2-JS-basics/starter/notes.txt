********************************* Lecture 6 **********************************

There are two ways to insert JavaScript into a webpage, through inline scripts or through links to external scripts. Even though links to external scripts cause you to make another network download, they are definitely the preferred way for writing JavaScript and they are the method we will use in this course.

********************************** Lecture 8 *********************************

Variables are used in every programming language, and they are a way to store a value for use throughout a program. We declare variables in JavaScript with the 'var' keyword. 

JavaScript has 5 data primitive data types:
  1. Number - always floating point
  2. String
  3. Boolean
  4. Undefined - a variable that doesn't have a value yet
  5. Null = 'non-existent'

JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, which means that we don't have to define what type of value a variable will hold. In other languages, you need to define what data type a variable will hold before you can assign anything to it, these are known as statically typed languages. Variables can change what type of data type they hold throughout a program simply by being assigned to a new data type.

Variables should have meaningful names, and be in camelCase notation. They should not start with a number or a symbol, unless it is the $ or _. You also cannot use reserved JavaScript keywords as variable names.

***************************** Lecture 9 **************************************

In JavaScript, data types can become other data types in certain expressions. In expressions where you are basically concatenating variables with strings, any variables that are numbers, booleans, or even undefined will be converted to the string representation of themselves. Since JavaScript is dynamically typed, the value in the variable can change on the fly. You can also redefine a variable from one data type to the other.

**************************** Lecture 10 ***************************************

JavaScript has basic arithmetic operators like +, -, / and *. There are also the basic logical operators > and <, which return a boolean value. While the arithmetic and logical operators require more than one value, the typeof operator operates on a single value.

**************************** Lecture 11 ***************************************

JavaScript operators don't execute in the order they appear, but instead follow the languages rules of operator precedence. Google it whenever you get hung up on why an expression isn't turning out like you expect, there is no way to memorize the whole list.

You can assign to more than one variable at a time since the assignment operator has such a low precedence, and it evaluates right to left. There are also handy arithmetic assingment operators that allow you to perform an operation on a variable using the variable, then assign the result to the variable.
